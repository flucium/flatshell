# Workforce and Task Distribution
This document provides an at-a-glance overview of the task assignments within the FlatShell project. It is primarily intended to facilitate communication among contributors, rather than for end-users.

## Note
This shows who's doing what.

But right now, on February 19, 2024, only flucium is working on the tasks, so it looks like flucium has a lot of work to do.

It's not that other contributors aren't assigned to the tasks or are slacking off. It's just that this is my project and I'm taking charge of the tasks at the start.

Please be respectful of other contributors. As I mentioned before, this is my project and I initiated it, so I am simply taking the lead and working on many of the tasks at this stage.

## Tasks
Only major tasks are listed. 

As a general rule, tasks that are excluded from commit by '.gitignore' will not be listed here, even if they are major tasks.
